I am an assistant professor in the [MPI Lab](https://mpi.aass.oru.se/){:target="\_blank"} at Ã–rebro University, Sweden.
Broadly speaking, my research interests lie with artificial intelligence and machine learning, with a specialized emphasis on neuro-symbolic methods. In essence, my work involves harmonizing formal models of the world, usually provided by domain experts or grounded in scientific theories, with powerful function approximators such as neural networks.
My overarching scientific objective centers on the development of systems capable of both reasoning and learning when confronted with raw sensory data. To attain this ambitious goal, I advocate for a comprehensive approach, a philosophy also reflected in my diverse research activities. These activities span a spectrum that encompasses, inter alia, probabilistic inference with discrete-continuous data, neuro-probabilistic programming, and cognitive robotics.


Prior to my appointment as assistant professor I spent already two years in the MPI Lab as a PostDoc. This was preceded by a postdoctoral fellowship in the [DTAI Lab](http://dtai.cs.kuleuven.be/){:target="\_blank"} at the KU Leuven, Belgium, where I also obtained my PhD
under the supervision of [Luc De Raedt](https://wms.cs.kuleuven.be/people/lucderaedt){:target="\_blank"}.
